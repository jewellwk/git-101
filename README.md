## Git and GitHub

The goal of these exercises is to give you practice with basic git operations. Follow the steps in each of the exercises. Please note that more than one command might be required to perform some of the steps.

You will also need to have created a personal access token to push your repo to GitHub.

### Exercise 1

1. Create a project folder named `your_first_name_exercise1` (use your first name) and initialize it as a git repo.
2. Create a Python file `main.py` in the project folder that has one print statement.
3. Stage and commit the changes to the repo with the message:
   - `added first print statement`
4. Add a second print statement to the Python file.
5. Stage and commit the changes to the repo with the message:
   - `added second print statement`
6. Type: `git log`. Take a screenshot of the output.
7. Create a remote that’s associated with the URL of the repo (`git push`).
8. On the GitHub site, take a screenshot of the contents of the `main.py` file. (The screenshot should include the URL of the repo in the address bar.)

### Exercise 2

1. Get the URL of the repo of one of your team members in the breakout room.
2. Go up a directory (so that you’re no longer in your project directory).
3. Clone your group member’s repo to your VM (`git clone ...`).
4. Be mindful of what branch you are on.
5. Add a third print statement to `main.py` (do not modify anything else).
6. Stage and commit the changes with the message:
   - `added third print statement`
7. Type: `git log`. Take a screenshot of the output.
